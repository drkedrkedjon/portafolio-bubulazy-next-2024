I am making a small photo gallery component with React using styled-components and CSS grid. It accepts only 4 images, and when clicked, the image expands to full width.

Well, it works fine, but it won't animate with CSS transitions. I will try to fix it. I watched some videos with `width: auto;` and `interpolate-size: allow-keywords;`, but it still does not work. I'll try to do it in the future...
