## Though process

Since my blog is built with React and NEXT.js, there was no need to implement the theme switchers using plain CSS without JS. I utilise Server-Side Rendering and Server-Side Components, where the HTML is rendered on the server and sent to the client. Certain parts of the navigation and a few other elements rely on React hydration, but the user can see the full UI with HTML and CSS even without JS.

### CSS

If a user has JS disabled and prefers their chosen OS theme, that's the initial rendering they'll experience. Here is a CSS code

```css
:root {
  --clr-primario: 175 42% 90%;
  --clr-secundario: 161 40% 90%;
  ...;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --clr-primario: 198 37% 15%;
    --clr-secundario: 198 31% 17%;
    ...;
  }
}
```

I use custom properties for colors and as light theme is by default chosen by majority of users that’s what is in :root. And older browsers that do not understand `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` can load variables fine and light theme will be available.

Inside `@media` we have same custom properties with different values for dark theme and for modern browsers that du understand `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.

With this code we have applied theme as per user preferences in his operating system settings. No JS is necessary. That’s fine. Old browsers get light theme, modern as chosen by user.

### React and JS

If the user has JS enabled, the header component will hydrate and we can use useState() and useEffect() hooks to implement theme toggle
