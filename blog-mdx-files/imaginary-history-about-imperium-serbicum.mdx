title: In en alternate universe, there is an imaginary history about Imperium Serbicum.
abstract: This is a humorous twist on events in our universe as recounted by historians. The plot revolves around how one group of Slavis meridionalibus, the Serbs, managed to conquer nearly the entire Balkan peninsula and established Imperium Serbicum and then they blow up. While the story is not true, it is plausible in an alternate universe. It explores the consequences of being tardy, choosing the wrong friend at the opportune moment and insisting on imposible.

## Beginnings

> How it all started... The Roman Empire broke in two halves right on todayâ€™s border between Bosnia and Serbia 300 years before following imaginary occurrences.

### Early middle ages

In our own parallel universe, a bunch of Slavic savages emigrated from the geographic area where present-day Ukraine and Poland are situated into the Balkan Peninsula. As it happens in any massive human emigration, new folks either integrate into local culture or they push locals into the sea. In this case, the sea's name is the Adriatic. Those that survived are Albanians and Greeks. The happy Slavs split into tribes and made their tiny little shitty kingdoms.

### 1346 

One of those little shitty kingdoms became, for unknown reasons, significant. Significant enough to be considered as one of the most important kingdoms in Europe during that historic period. It originated as the Kingdom of Serbia. It was declared the Serbian Empire with the capital in Skopje, and soon the empire burned like a phoenix twenty-five years later. Unfortunately, for the vast majority of humans in the Balkans, the Serbs have a pathological myth of recovering that same empire, and the myth is alive to the present day.

### Turks
