title: In en alternate universe, there is an imaginary history about Imperium Serbicum.
abstract: This is a funny twist on what happened in our universe as told by historians. The plot goes about how one group of Slavis meridionalibus, the Serbs, managed to conquer almost whole of the Balkan and create Imperium Serbicum. The story is not true, but it is plausible. It is about how to be late and and how to chose the wrong friend at the right time.
